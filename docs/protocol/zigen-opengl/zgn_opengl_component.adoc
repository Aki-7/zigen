= zgn_opengl_component

Graphic Pipeline へのひとまとまりの入力を表す interface.
主に Virtual object に描画する内容に関する double-buffered state を更新する。
vertex buffer と shader program が attach され、少なくとも一つ以上の vertex attribute
を持っていて、set_count がされていないと object は render されない。

== destroy
`request`

Destroy zgn_opengl_component. Objects attached to a zgn_opengl_component will
not be destroyed unless otherwise stated in their interface protocols.

== attach_vertex_buffer
`request`

Attach zgn_opengl_vertex_buffer object to a zgn_opengl_component.
A zgn_opengl_component cannot have more than one vertex buffer, and if another
vertex buffer has already attached, it will be replaced.

The vertex buffer will not be detached event after the next
zgn_virtual_object.commit unlike wl_surface.attach.

Whether the vertex buffer is attached or not is double-buffered state.

== attach_shader_program
`request`

Attach zgn_opengl_shader_program object to a zgn_opengl_component.
A zgn_opengl_component cannot have more than one shader program, and if another
shader program has already attached, it will be replaced.

The shader program will not be detached event after the next
zgn_virtual_object.commit unlike wl_surface.attach.

Whether the shader program is attached or not is double-buffered state.

== attach_texture
`request`

Attach zgn_opengl_texture object to a zgn_opengl_component.
A zgn_opengl_component cannot have more than one texture, and if another
texture has already attached, it will be replaced.

The texture will not be detached event after the next
zgn_virtual_object.commit unlike wl_surface.attach.

Whether the texture is attached or not is double-buffered state.

== add_vertex_attribute
`request`

Add vertex attribute information to a zgn_opengl_component.
The vertex attributes a zgn_opengl_component has are double-buffered state.

Please see the specification of OpenGL `glVertexAttribPointer` for more
information.

== clear_vertex_attribute
`request`

Clear the vertex attributes a zgn_opengl_component has.
The vertex attributes a zgn_opengl_component has are double-buffered state.

== set_topology
`request`

Set topology mode for rendering. The topology mode is double-buffered state.
A compositor has a default value "lines".

Please see the specification of OpenGL `glDrawArrays` or `glDrawElements` for more
information.

== set_min
`request`

Specifies the starting index in the enabled arrays.
A compositor has a default value 0. This value is double-buffered state.

// this value will also be used for glDrawRangeElements in the future.

== set_count
`request`

Set the maximum array index to be rendered.
A compositor has a default value 0. This value is double-buffered state.

// this value will also be used for glDrawElements in the future.
