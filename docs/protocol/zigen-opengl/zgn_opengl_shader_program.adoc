= zgn_opengl_shader_program

This is an interface to create and build shader programs.

A zgn_opengl_shader_program which has not been called
zgn_opengl_shader_program.link is useless. Clients need to call
zgn_opengl_shader_program.link before the zgn_virtual_object.commit
to use the shader programs for the rendering in the commit.

== destroy
`request`

Destroy a zgn_opengl_shader_program object.

== set_vertex_shader
`request`

Set the contents of vertex shader. The compositor reads and compiles the shader
immediately, and if the compilation fails, the request raises compilation_error.

Clients need to call zgn_opengl_shader_program.link after this request to apply
the changes.

The contents of vertex buffer are double-buffered state.

== set_fragment_shader
`request`

Set the contents of fragment shader. The compositor reads and compiles the
shader immediately, and if the compilation fails, the request raises
compilation_error.

Clients need to call zgn_opengl_shader_program.link after this request to apply
the changes.

The contents of fragment buffer are double-buffered state.

== link
`request`

This request links the shader programs set to a zgn_opengl_shader_program before
this request. If it fails to link, this request raises linkage_error.

From the next zgn_virtual_object.commit, the changes to the shader programs
will be applied to the zgn_opengl_component which has this
zgn_opengl_shader_program.
