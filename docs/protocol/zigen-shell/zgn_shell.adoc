= zgn_shell

The zgn_shell interface is exposed as a global object enabling clients to turn
their zgn_virtual_objects into cuboid windows. It defines the basic
functionality needed for clients and the compositor to create cuboid windows
that can be dragged, resized, rotated, etc, as well as transient cuboid windows
such as preview objects during drag & drop action.

== destroy
`request`

Destroy this zgn_shell object.

Destroying a bound zgn_shell object while there are surfaces still alive
created by this zgn_shell object instance is illegal and will result in
zgn_shell.defunct_virtual_object error.

== get_cuboid_window
`request`

This creates a zgn_cuboid_window object for the given zgn_virtual_object and
gives the cuboid window role to the virtual object.

The compositor uses the half_size argument as a hint of the size of a new cuboid
window. The client should not rely on the compositor to obey the value. The
compositor may decide to ignore the value.

The half_size argument should be a float array of size 3, and each float value
should be greater than zero. Otherwise, the request will be an
invalid_cuboid_window_size error.
